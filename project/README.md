## Project
Historical weather data were obtained from the Met Éireann website.
As the data are provided separately for individual stations, an automated data collection process was implemented using Python to download, clean, and merge multiple datasets into a single unified dataset suitable for analysis.
The analysis focuses on the period 1995–2024, which provides a sufficiently long time series to examine seasonal patterns and long-term trends in wind speeds, while ensuring reasonable data quality and availability across multiple stations.
Ten meteorological stations were selected to ensure balanced geographical coverage across Ireland, including northern, southern, eastern, and western regions, as well as coastal and inland locations.
This selection reduces location bias and allows meaningful comparison of wind speed patterns across different climatic regions.

Selected meteorological stations by region

North: Malin Head

South: Roches Point, Sherkin Island, Valentia Observatory

East: Dublin Airport, Phoenix Park, Casement Aerodrome

West: Belmullet

Central (inland): Mullingar, Claremorris
