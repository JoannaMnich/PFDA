# Introduction
This repository contains assignments and project work completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module. It showcases practical applications of Python, data processing techniques, and analytical workflows commonly used in real-world data science environments.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Grouping, filtering, and aggregating data
- Visualisation of data trends
- Applying best practices for reproducible analytics
- Working with real datasets and converting them into insights

## Assignment
#### 1. Assignment 2
   
A Python program that retrieves and prints the dates of all official bank holidays in Northern Ireland. The script demonstrates:

- Working with dates and times in Python
- Accessing structured data
- Formatting and displaying date information
- 
#### 2. Assignment 3

Analysis of email addresses to extract domains and visualise their distribution. Includes:

- String manipulation using pandas
- Value counts and frequency analysis
- A pie chart showing domain proportions

#### 3. Assignment 5

This assignment performs a full demographic analysis of Ireland’s population. The goal is to understand the age structure, compare male and female populations, and analyze regional differences.

- Loaded the CSO population dataset and cleaned it for analysis.
- Using pd.cut() to create age groups and aggregating population counts by age group, gender, and county.
- Generated summary tables displaying demographic distributions.
- Created visual graphs to demonstrate age and gender distribution.
- Extracted information about which counties have the biggest population difference between sexes in the age group.

#### 4. Assignment 6

Exploratory analysis of daily weather conditions at Ireland West Airport, Knock. Features:

- Loading and cleaning the dataset, converting dates, and dealing with missing values—particularly in the windspeed column.
- Plotting the temperature data, calculating the daily mean temperature, and producing the monthly mean temperature to observe seasonal trends.
- Examines wind speed behaviour by creating a plot of the raw wind speed values
- Identifying the maximum wind speed for each day, and generating a monthly mean of these daily maximum values

# Conclusion

This repo demonstrates the practical programming skills acquired during the Programming for Data Analytics module. It highlights your ability to work with real data, build analytic workflows, and produce clear, replicable results.
