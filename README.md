# Introduction
This repository contains assignments and project work completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module. It showcases practical applications of Python, data processing techniques, and analytical workflows commonly used in real-world data science environments.

## Repo Structure

- **[Assignments](assignments/README.md)**  
  Scripts and notebooks for assignments, e.g., bank holidays, pie charts, population, and weather analysis.

- **[Project](my-work/project/README.md)**  
  Main project with data analysis:
  - `project.ipynb` – analysis notebook
  - `merge_stations.py` – preprocessing script
  - `data/` – CSV files used for visualizations and outputs

- **Other files**  
  - `.gitignore`
  - `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

# Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Grouping, filtering, and aggregating data
- Visualisation of data trends
- Applying best practices for reproducible analytics
- Working with real datasets and converting them into insights

# Conclusion
